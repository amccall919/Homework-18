# Homework-18
Citi Bike Challenge

In this assignment, I developed visualizations, dashboards, and a narrative using Tableau, focusing on the New York Citi Bike Programâ€”the largest bike-sharing initiative in the United States.

Since its launch in 2013, the Citi Bike program has built a comprehensive system for gathering usage data. Monthly data is collected, organized, and shared publicly on the [Citi Bike Data webpage](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).


The Tableau dashboard created here is designed to support a streamlined reporting process, offering a set of visualizations to deliver data insights to city officials.
