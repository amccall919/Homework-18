Citi Bike Challenge

In this assignment, I developed visualizations, dashboards, and a narrative using Tableau, focusing on the New York Citi Bike Programâ€”the largest bike-sharing initiative in the United States.

Since its launch in 2013, the Citi Bike program has built a comprehensive system for gathering usage data. Monthly data is collected, organized, and shared publicly on the [Citi Bike Data webpage](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).


The Tableau dashboard created here is designed to support a streamlined reporting process, offering a set of visualizations to deliver data insights to city officials.

## Data Used
I used data from the 202410-citibike-tripdata_1.csv and 202410-citibike-tripdata_5.csv file. These files used data from October 2024. I was unable to use more than two data sets as the instructions stated that Tableau would have problems handling a large data file. So that is why I chose these two data files instead of trying to use data that covered an entire year. 

## Tableau Public Link
The following is the link on Tableau Public to access my visualizations:

## Key Insights
Using Tableau, I visualized the top 10 most popular starting and ending locations for riders. For October, the data revealed that classic bikes were more widely used than electric bikes, with October 20th being the busiest day for both bike types. The analysis also showed that members consistently used the bikes more frequently than casual riders. This project was an excellent learning experience, allowing me to transform data into meaningful visualizations and gain valuable insights.
